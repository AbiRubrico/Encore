                <h1>What are the advantages of CSS?</h1>
                <p>CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</p>
                <p>Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every
time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less
code means faster download times.  </p>
                <p>Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all
the web pages will be updated automatically.</p>
                <p>Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can
give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</p>
                <p>Multiple Device Compatibility − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one
type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be
presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</p>
                <p>Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being
recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to
make them compatible to future browsers.</p>
