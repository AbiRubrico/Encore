Javascript
	Javascripts environment is very dynamic you can code your program inside your html codes.
	<script> is very important in creating a java script which indicates that your Javascript function is already started each line of codes are called STATEMENTS like your java each statements ends with semi-colon (;). 
	Example:
		Document.write(“webtek2019);
Variable
	In javaScript you can define variable in 2 different types you can define it as var or you can define it as let. Like java you can declare your variable and call it
	var stmt = “Hello Wurld”
	var stmt1;
Global Variable
	Global variables are javascript codes that can be found outside the <script> where you can call it anytime. 
Local Variable 
	Local variables are codes that can be found inside a function, where in Only the Function can call it.
Functions
	Set of statements that are combined together. Functions are the body of the code along with the variables.
	Example
		Function name()  {
			//Code
			}
DOM 
	Document object Model (DOM) allows to access the html documents in the script. It usually represented with a tree which contains node, each nodes represent the components of html.
